# Python-Encryption

This is an University project, using Python, with two scripts (encrypt.py / decrypt.py), which take a key and a text file, as a parameter in the terminal, and perform XOR encryption / decryption, using the given key. The program uses the key to encrypt the contents of the text file.

XOR (eXclusive OR) is a logical operator that returns a true value if one, but not both, of its operands is true.

Its function table:

a | b | a ^ b
--|---|------
0 | 0 |   0
0 | 1 |   1
1 | 0 |   1
1 | 1 |   0
